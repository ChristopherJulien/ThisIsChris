App Idea

Decision Fatigue
refers to the deteriorating quality of decisions made by an individual after a long session of decision making.
 Barack Obama, Steve Jobs, and Mark Zuckerberg have been known to reduce their everyday clothing down to one or two outfits in order to limit the number of decisions they make in a day.		[wiki: Decision Fatigue]

App Idea

What if you could manage to everyday wear the perfect outfit without it being the same outfit?
Start with my introduction 

To develop an Android application that alleviates the mental energy of outfit selection in the morning.

The user builds a virtual closet and the application formulates an outfit suggestion. 

Suggestions are based on the user’s desire for "Sports, Fashionable, Comfortable",

Suggestions take into account clothes’ cleanliness

Suggestions take into account weather

Start with my introduction

4. Watch Implementation
1) The watch is notified when we select a outfit and recover the cleanliness of the outfit.
2) The watch start to take the heart rate.
3) For a define interval of time, depending of the heart rate we reduce the cleanliness of the outfit.
4) The cleanliness of the clothes is shown on the watch.
5) The watch notified the smartphone of the new cleanliness of the clothes.
